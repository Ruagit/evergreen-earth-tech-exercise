# Overview

Propose a solution to the problem statement listed in the Readme of this project. The solution proposed will be a Node/TypeScript service which provides a summary based on the calculcations and processing of the provided house, heat pump and external data. The service should consider error handling, edge cases for missing data and testing for logic contained in the service. The output will be displayed in the console for the purposes of this project using node's console api.

Testing will be done to cover the logic contained in the service and 3rd party api's will not be tested as their functionality is outside of our control.
