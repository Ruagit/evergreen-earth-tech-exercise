## Overview

The idea of the exercise is to solve the following problem, we don't expect it to take longer than two hours and all the data/tools should be available. Things we're looking for are:

- Tests, either TDD or test-after
- Easy to read, maintainable code
- Frequent git commits

We're **not** looking for a UI! You can use either plain JavaScript or TypeScript.

The provided API is mildly unstable by design, but if you cannot get it to work at all, please get in touch.

You can either submit via a public repository (e.g. github/gitlab/etc.) or via zipped folder.

## Problem

A recently implemented data collection form provides an array of customer submitted housing details, you are implementing the processing which will take each house in the provided json and provide an output summary to be used in providing the customer the quote. The output should be in the form, list each house separately, with the correct values populated:

```
--------------------------------------
<Submission ID>
--------------------------------------
  Estimated Heat Loss =
  Design Region =
  Power Heat Loss =
  Recommended Heat Pump =
  Cost Breakdown
    <label>, <cost>
    <label>, <cost>
    ...
  Total Cost, including VAT =
```

The provided API was built by a third party and somewhat strange behaviour has been reported in some cases - we are assured this will not be a problem in production. Additionally, some regions are not yet supported by the API, if the designRegion cannot be found by the API (it should return a 404 in this case), then the following output is expected, and further calculations should not be attempted.

```
--------------------------------------
<Submission ID>
--------------------------------------
  Heating Loss: 29710.8
  Warning: Could not find design region
```

## Steps

1.  Calculate the heat loss for each property. Heat loss can be calculated using the following formula:

        floorArea (m^2) * heatingFactor * insulationFactor = heat loss (kWh)

2.  Using weather data from the API and the property's design region, calculate the power heat loss of the property using the total heat loss calculated and the returned heating degree days:

        heat loss (kWh) / heating degree days = Power heat loss (kW)

3.  Using the data in the heat-pumps.json file match a heat pump to the property using the property's calculated power heat loss and each heat pump's output capacity. Calculate the total cost for the heat pump installation - total costs should include 5% VAT.
    _Note: the Heat Pump should **not be undersized**._

## Weather Data API

An API is available to retrieve the heating degree days for a given location (`designRegion` in the houses.json file):

```
https://063qqrtqth.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/weather?location=<location>
```

You will need to provide the following API Authentication key as a header:

```
x-api-key = f661f74e-20a7-4e9f-acfc-041cfb846505
```

Example response:

```
{
    "location": {
        "location": "Borders (Boulmer)",
        "degreeDays": "2483",
        "groundTemp": "9",
        "postcode": "NE66",
        "lat": "55.424",
        "lng": "-1.583"
    }
}
```
